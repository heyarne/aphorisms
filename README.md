## Development Environment

The repository contains a couple of files that help set up a solid development environment.

- `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` describe how to set up an environment using [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes). To use those set up `nix` with experimental flake support and run `nix develop`.
- `.envrc` is set up so that the development environment is automatically set up via direnv

## Usage

There are individual files in `src/aphorisms`, each containing one sketch or variations of the same sketch.
